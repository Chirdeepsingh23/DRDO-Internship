# DRDO-Internship
This repository contains the report as well as simulink files for my work done during an internship in the Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC) Lab at Defence Research and Development Organization, India. 
The project contains electronic circuits which were designed in Simulink and their output waveforms were then studied.
